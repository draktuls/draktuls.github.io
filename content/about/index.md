My name is Honza and I go by drak or draktuls *(Yes it's from Warcraft)*.

Nowadays I mainly focus on low-level stuff which includes Exploit Development, Vulnerability Research and Reverse Engineering.
I like to challenge myself in these areas and grow my knowledge. The primary interest is currently in the realms of Mobile exploitation and also reverse engineering vendor firmwares.

Apart from these skills I occasionally also do Web Exploitation or Penetration Testing related stuff and I am very much fond of writing custom offensive tooling including post-exploitation payloads.
